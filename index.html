    <h1>Frieda Jacobson</h1>
    <p>Hello! I like learning everything related to science and math and engineering and language (but don't make me go to history class!)</p>
    <p>This webpage is a bit dull at the moment, I'm just using it as a jumping off point at the moment</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Here's my <a href='https://gatsby-nine-brown.vercel.app/' >website</a> that I built with Gatsby</li>
      <li>Here's my solo project,  <a href='https://cross-stitch-buddy.herokuapp.com/'>Cross Stitch</a>
        , the first website I've ever built, which I built in a two week sprint for the purpose of keeping
         track of string for cross stitch projects. You might try logging in as mia, with a password of mia,
          to get a chance to see it with some data. </li>
